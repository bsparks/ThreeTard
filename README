ThreeTard.js

Super Simple Game Framework written on top of Three.js and other libs.

This is HTML5 game dev for dummies!

Just include Three.js & threetard.js at the top and then it can be as simple as:

```javascript
ThreeTard.makeCube(1, 200);

ThreeTard.controlCameraUsingArrowKeys();

ThreeTard.start();
```
